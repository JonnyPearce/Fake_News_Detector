Fake News Detector
==============================

Using natural language processing to build a fake news detector

The reliability of information is key to businesses, governments and media organisations around the world. The rise of misinformation and fake news has a massive impact on business and government to effect change or develop appropriate responses/behavioural change within society, as well as sell products and provide services. With the rise of social media and online forums, and with customers becoming content generators, businesses have even more to contend with.

They have to manage business and product/service reputation issues linked with fake news or misinformation, along with dealing with an increasing number and range of regulatory and compliance requirements covering legal and liability responsibilities to do with managing fake news, false information and abuse/offensive content/materials
Thus, knowing what is true and what is fake in terms of protecting your own business (either as a publishing organisation or as a product producer or service provider) and enhancing your reputation and profile is crucial.
So, reliable and effective tools that can help governments, businesses and media/publishing organisations manage fake news and false/misleading information will only become more and more important. This project set out to create a fake news detector to address such issues.

The project carries out the following steps:

•	Data wrangling/cleaning/standardisation
•	Exploratory data analysis.
•	Vectorization of the text data (with consideration given to different text vectorization methods).
•	Model training, building and testing, using a number of different machine learning classification algorithms.
•	Model selection (including refinement and parameter tuning).

Resulting in a PassiveAggressive Classifier Model with just under 99% accuracy.
